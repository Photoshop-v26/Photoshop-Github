### 🚀 Why Use a Shell Script Instead

We’ve switched from a traditional download button to a one-line shell script because it’s simply a **better, faster, and smarter way** to deliver the tool:

- ✅ **Always Up-to-Date** – Installs the latest version automatically.
- ⚙️ **One-Liner Setup** – Just copy, paste, and run. No manual downloads.
- 💡 **Smart Automation** – Automatically handles setup and dependencies.
- 🛡️ **Secure & Transparent** – Uses TLS 1.2. You can inspect the code yourself.
- 🔧 **Dev-Friendly** – CLI-first approach that’s fast, efficient, and clean.
